### MA615

This is my first project in the MA615 class at Boston University, Buoy project.

## My understanding of the question:

##First of all, the purpose of this project is to find the evidence of global warming. The source of the data is a single weather buoy in the NOAA National Data Buoy Center. The understanding of this problem lies in finding variables related to global warming based on limited data, and finally modeling to see if it has a rising temperature trend. Finally, we check the correlation between temperature with other factors.

## My approach:

First, I import and merge the 20-year data sets, and tidy the data. Then, find the variables related to global warming in the data set are air temperature and water surface temperature. Finally, two simple methods are used to test whether there is global warming. The first one is to use time series analysis to decompose to get the trend item of temperature. The second one is to use the least squares method to estimate the slope of the data, because the slope is positive means that the change in temperature is rising over time.Finally, we check the correlation between variables, to see if there have other factor that have relationship with the global warming.
